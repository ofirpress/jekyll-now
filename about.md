I recently completed my masters degree at Tel-Aviv University were I worked on language modeling, translation and language generation with my advisor [Lior Wolf](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/) and [Jonathan Berant](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/). Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in math and computer science at Tel-Aviv University and worked as a software developer.
