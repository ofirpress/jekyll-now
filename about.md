I am a graduate student in the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). 

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science at Tel Aviv University and briefly worked as a software developer. 

In my research I try to find simple methods that make neural language and translation models faster, smaller and more accurate.
